# CodeSprint2022
A codesprint challenge with a brief. Done in a solo competitive (fun) environment within a 32 hour time limit. Competition held by codesprint malta / ice malta.

Uses AWS rekognition, PyQt framework. Requires AWS logins to run. Run setup.py for installation and run Main_App.py

Readme file contained more details on how to install and run this app, I am trying to recover this file to include it in the project.
